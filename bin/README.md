## uninstall

This utility is called automatically by the project's build system when the user
specifies the uninstall target (i.e. 'make uninstall'). This utility should not
be called manually! It can damage your system if not used correctly.

## package

This utility can be used to package the project's directory structure into a tarball. It should be called from the project's root directory. The output will be written to the project's root directory.

Example:
```
$ cd hpca_semester_project
$ bin/package
$ ls
bin  CMakeLists.txt  examples  hpca_semester_project.tar.gz  notebooks  README.md  src
```
