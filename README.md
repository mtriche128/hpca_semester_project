# The HPCA Semester Project

## Overview

This is the HPCA semester project for Mike Morgan and Matthew Triche.

## Getting Started

### Background

All libraries and scripts compiled and processed by the project's build system are installed to and ran from within the project's directory structure without needing define special environment variables. This project is intended to be portable as possible. To achieve this, cmake was leveraged and forms the backbone of the project's build system.

### Pre-Reqs

* cmake (>= v3.7)
* python2.7
* numpy
* matplotlib

### Building and Installing

From within the project's root directory, create a new sub-directory called 'build'. It will contain the build tree generated by cmake. Once cmake has been run, Makefiles will be automatically generated which can build and install all the nessessary components.

```
$ cd hpca_semester_project
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ makefiles
$ make install
```

### Running Examples

To run examples, go to the 'examples' sub-directory.

```
$ python measure_libcbm.py
$ python test_libcbm.py
```
